# FocusTime
FocusTime is a React Native productivity app bootstrapped with Expo and built through the Zero to Mastery React Native course on Udemy.

Please visit [my snack](https://snack.expo.dev/@dvorakjt/focustime) for the deployed version!

## Features
FocusTime allows users to input a task they would like to focus on and select a duration of 10, 15 or 20 minutes. Once the duration is selected, a timer begins counting down. Users can cancel an in-progress task. All tasks are saved with AsyncStorage and are flagged as completed or incomplete. Users can clear their task history.
