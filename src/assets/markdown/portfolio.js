# Portfolio
A React-powered portfolio showcasing my favorite projects.
## Concept

This page is an homage to the art of coding. The page begins like many developers do with a "Hello world" screen. In the same way that this page represents an introduction of myself to the the coding community, the Hello World program is the classic introductory program for new programmers. The home page aims to capture my fascination with the way that a Hello World program, written in a simple text editor, can be the gateway to the creation of much more complex code, and, eventually, even stunning, digital worlds.

As we become more interested in coding, we move from the simple text editor to the use of an IDE. The remainder of the page is a play on the light and dark modes often offered by IDEs. The idea of toggling between these two color schemes was also inspired by the About section, which features a bio section and a skillset section, which like light mode and dark mode, represent two halves of one whole.
## Features
The page is responsive, cross-browser compatible, and designed with accessibility for users using assistive technology (i.e. screen readers) in mind. A toggler fixed to the bottom righthand corner of the screen allows users to switch between light mode and dark mode.

The home page features an introductory animation, and a responsive navbar. There is an About section in which users an toggle between a bio and a list of some of my coding skills. The projects section features an animated taskbar from which users can select different projects to view. The projects README file displays along with a screenshot of the project.

Smooth scrolling is applied to the entire page, and CSS transitions and animations are used throughout to give the page a sense of movement.
